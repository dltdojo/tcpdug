[Pipeline (Unix) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))

> In Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing. A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output text of each process (stdout) is passed directly as input (stdin) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently. 

> For example, to list files in the current directory (ls), retain only the lines of ls output containing the string "key" (grep), and view the result in a scrolling page (less), a user types the following into the command line of a terminal: 

```
ls -l | grep key | less
```

> A “message” in XCM is actually just a programme that runs on the XCVM. It is one or more XCM instructions. The programme executes until it either runs to the end or hits an error, at which point it finishes up (I’m leaving that intentionally unexplained for now) and halts.

# This is just a little script that can be downloaded from the internet to
# install rustup. It just does platform detection, downloads the installer
# and runs it.

# It runs on Unix shells like {a,ba,da,k,z}sh. It uses the common `local`
# extension. Note: Most shells limit `local` to 1 var per line, contra bash.

# 跨鏈的可組合型模型(OSI model?)

跨共識訊息為何需要特定規格？位元流不行？

用上面同步的管道標示 ```|``` 不太適合區塊鏈非同步型態，故改用 ```$|,$|$,|$``` 來象徵的是非同步需消費資源的訊息管道。

```
ChainAlice Dapp101 $|$ ChainBob Dapp876+ERC20 $| sed 's/balance:199/balance:299/1' |$ ChainFoo Dapp333
```

> Secondly, common use-cases on chains do not easily fit into a single transaction; special tricks may be required to withdraw funds, exchange them and then deposit the result all inside a single transaction. Onward notifications of transfers, needed for a coherent reserve-asset framework, do not exist in chains unaware of others.

```
ChainAlice Banking101-Withdraw $|$ ChainBob DappSwap343-Exchange $| tee notification-ChainBar |$ ChainFoo Dapp786-Deposit
```

XCM Goals

> XCM aims to be a language communicating ideas between consensus systems. It should be general enough for it to be properly useful throughout a growing ecosystem. It should be extensible. Since the extensibility will inevitably imply change, it should also be future-proof and forwards-compatible. Finally, it should be efficient enough to run on-chain, and possibly in a metered environment.
